Fantasy football can be a cruel mistress. 
She teases you with flashy numbers and promises of big things, but every year seems to end in disappointment.
The goal of this project is not to provide you with a cheat sheet for who to draft in order to win it all (plenty of those exist already).
The goal is to set realistic expectations that prepare you for any and all situation that you may come across during the year. 
Factors like injury history, team environment, coaching, etc. should and will be used in determining how a player will perform. 
Sometimes it is important to step back and remind yourself that these players are just people. They aren't immune to emotions or outside circumstances that have nothing to do with talent or expectations.
